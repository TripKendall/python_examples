## Python, a slight return

Python is what inspired me to get back into coding but I have not done it in a while. Python is kind of beautiful; almost elegant compared to JavaScript.

As I have had occasion to (re)use it more and more, I have found that I have had to relearn a few things. This is where I am collecting some of the files I generate as I dip my toes back into the pythonic waters.  As it were.

#### [Normalize a Pandas DataFrame Column](https://github.com/TripKendall/python_examples/tree/main/normalizePandasCol)
I will document my data cleaning efforts in a separate file but I wanted to share this little bit of code that I wrote to normalize a column in a Pandas DataFrame.  There are many ways to accomplish anything in Python but this is what I came up with.  

I also wanted to share just how simple Pythoin can be if one lets it...

**The last run finished with:**
```
- neg:    25338
- pos:    22057
```
### [Multi-File DataFrame]()
Have a bunch of json files that you want to combine into a single DataFrame?  This is how I did it, maybe it will help you too.
